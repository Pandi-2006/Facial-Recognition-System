# Facial-Recognition-System
This project is a complete facial recognition system. It uses the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, an MTCNN model for face detection, EfficientNet for feature extraction, and a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) to identify individuals. The final model was trained on 423 individuals and achieved a test accuracy of 21.28%.
